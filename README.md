**Installation of `vim_runtime`**

    git submodule update --init --recursive
    ln -s dev-env/VIM/vim_runtime ~/.vim_runtime
    sh ~/.vim_runtime/install_awesome_vimrc.sh
    cd .vim_runtime/my_plugins/YouCompleteMe/
    ./install.py --clang-completer

 - Clone this repo in your home directory.
 - Init and update all git submodules recursively.
 - Create a symlink called `.vim_runtime` which points to the `vim_runtime` submodule from the repo which was cloned into the home directory.
